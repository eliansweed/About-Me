#🔐 "I don't just protect systems — I understand how they break."#


# 👋 Hi, I'm Elian Sweed

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast from 🇮🇱 Israel, passionate about Linux, scripting, and securing systems from real-world threats.

## 🐧 My Journey
My love for Linux started back in high school, where I built a small hosting service selling game servers. I created and managed my first website using cPanel.

After completing my military service, I joined a cybersecurity course at **Kernilos**. I revived my old website—not to sell servers this time, but to sharpen my scripting skills and focus on **hardening its security**.

## 🛡️ What I Do
- Block brute-force and subdirectory scanner attacks  
- Monitor logs and traffic through a SOC dashboard  
- Automatically block malicious IPs  
- Continuously improve server hardening and response strategies  
- Use real attacks as learning opportunities

## 🧰 Tools & Tech
- Linux (my daily driver)  
- Bash scripting  
- SOC monitoring  
- IP blocking and firewall configuration  
- Web hosting (cPanel, Apache, etc.)

## 🎯 Goals
- Advance in ethical hacking and penetration testing  
- Contribute to open-source cybersecurity tools  
- Share what I learn and grow with the infosec community
